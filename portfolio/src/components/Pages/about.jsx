                <p>
                    Hello, Im Dylan Gunda, a passionate, 28 year old web developer with a passion for creation and innovation. <br />
                    As a first generation immigrant, originally from Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, when i moved to the UK in 2001, <br />
                    I instantly fell in love with all the new things that we didn’t have, like candy floss, KFC and gaming. <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for gaming has never gone anywhere, in fact, this has only grown over time, <br />
                    spreading to all things technology and calumniating in where i am today, pursing a career in web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before transitioning, I gained a psychology degree, I spent a large portion of my adult life listening to people’s needs,<br />
                    adapting to constantly evolving work environments and handling complex caseloads.
                </p>
